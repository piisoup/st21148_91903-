              Imagine something in space that's so heavy and dense that nothing,
              not even light, can escape its pull. That's a black hole! It's not
              actually a hole you can fall into like in a cartoon; it's a place
              where gravity is so strong that it warps the fabric of space and
              time. This extreme gravity is created when a massive star
              collapses in on itself at the end of its life, crushing all of its
              matter into an infinitely small point called a singularity. The
              "point of no return" around this singularity is called the event
              horizon. Once something crosses this invisible line, it's trapped
              forever, destined to be pulled toward the center. Scientists can't
              see black holes directly because they don't emit any light, but
              they can detect them by observing the way they affect nearby stars
              and gas, which often orbit the black hole and get pulled in,
              heating up and emitting powerful X-rays.

              Imagine something that's basically a giant, cosmic "dirty
              snowball" made of frozen gases, rock, and dust. That's a comet!
              They spend most of their lives way out in the deep freeze of the
              solar system, but every once in a while, something nudges them
              into a long, looping orbit that brings them closer to the Sun. As
              a comet gets closer, the Sun's heat causes the ice to turn
              directly into gas, a process called sublimation. This gas and dust
              create a massive, glowing cloud around the core, called the coma,
              and a beautiful, long tail that can stretch for millions of miles.
              Because of the solar wind and pressure from sunlight, the tail
              always points away from the Sun, no matter which direction the
              comet is traveling. Studying comets is like getting a glimpse into
              a time machine; they're thought to be ancient leftovers from when
              our solar system was first formed over 4.6 billion years ago.
